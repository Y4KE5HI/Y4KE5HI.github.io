                    You're my valentine now. Our first Valentines Day together. I miss you so much. There's nothing in the world that means more to me than you. You're my everything 
                    and something and nothing and everything in between. Nothing even comes close to how I feel about you. I fall more and more in love 
                    with you every single day. You have that smile that makes my day and that gorgeous laugh, and I just can't stop myself from looking at you. Sometimes I wonder how I found 
                    someone I can trust with everything, love with all of my heart and still be best friends with them. You make me smile more than anything else, you make me laugh till it hurts, and I can't imagine a single day without you.
                    I'm genuinely the luckiest guy in the world. <br><br>
        
                    I'm so so in love with you Aabha. My pretty girl. You're so beautiful. Every single part of you is perfect. I look at you and I still get butterflies. That tooth that you hate so much is my absolute favourite, I 
                    can't explain why but it is. Maybe it's because I only see it when you smile. Your smile. It's so pretty. It lights up my entire day and you just look so happy that I can't help smiling either. Even on my worst days your smile and your hugs makes everything okay. 
                    When you put on that dress, I just had no words. I didn't know what to say, you looked so pretty. I was fully admiring you. Your waist, your hips, your tummy all looked beautiful and perfect. I just wanted to hold them. 
                    I had no clue what you were on about. I was like are this girl's eyes working properly?? And photo day. I couldn't find a single flaw in any one of your photos. You looked amazing in all of them. I had such a hard time choosing one cos I'd be like 'This one' and then I'd go to the next one and be like 'Ooo, no this one' so it was pretty tough. And you know when you look the prettiest to me. When you're wearing your frog oodie, chilling in bed with a messy bun.
                    I just have no words then. I just can't help but look at you. You're everything I could've ever dreamed of.<br><br>
        
                    I'm so so proud of you, my love. Even if you think I shouldn't be. I am and I have every reason to be. Just look at you. You're the most caring and thoughful person I've ever met. You're an amazing sister and I know every time you try something, you try your absolute best. And I trust you. I trust you with everything. I'm sorry I can't be with you tomorrow my love. I wish I could. I'm ginna call you all day and I promise I'll be there for every valentines day after this. Thank you for being so understanding. I love you. dskfjhsdkfjh<br><br>
